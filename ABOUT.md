# About Dragon Tester
[Dragon Tester](https://github.com/Team-Draconis/Dragon_Vercel "Github Repo") was developed by [Mako Kusudo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/makokusuda/ "Mako's LinkedIn"), [Shuntaro Maekawa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuntaro-maekawa/ "Shuntaro's LinkedIn"), [Zowie Min](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiayi-min/ "Zowie's Linked"), [Tam Nugyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tam-nguyen-70a7891a8/ "Tam's LinkedIn") and [Chip Crawford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chip-crawford-berkeley/ "Chip's LinkedIn") during their time at [Code Chrysalis Coding Boot Camp](https://www.codechrysalis.io/) in Tokyo, Japan. We were inspired by Zowie's experience as a recruiter to try to improve the experience for both the companies looking for talent and the talent themselves. Our goal was to allow jobseekers to lead with their skills and connect them with small to medium sized companies that may have been overlooked. 

Our focus was on creating a stable platform and refining the skills we learned at Code Chrysalis. Mako was in charge of using Docker and deploying the app to AWS, she also supported test development. Zowie was in charge of Database management and worked on user authentication with Tam. Tam helped on the backend, login and test development. Shuntaro created the test editor and was our frontend guru. Finally, Chip was the tech lead. He helped the team meet deadlines, performed QA tasks and wrote small features as needed. 

We hope our app can inspire your future projects and lead to a better way for people to showcase their talents!
